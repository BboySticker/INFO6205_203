# Coway's Game of Life 

## Find the infinite pattern by using the Genetic Algorithm.

- We found a pattern that could expend to 112 nodes from 13 nodes, after 1000 generation of Conway’s game of life. We thought this is a great pattern that worth to take a test like others. And we put it in a more larger canvas. We found out that after around 800 generations, it turns to follow a specific growth rule like the third picture. Based on our investigation, we thought we could think this model as the model which could infinite growth.
Although it seams like we have gave too much constrains to the scale of the pattern. But actually, we tried from 100*100 to 5*5 for a long range of times. We have run several times and took a long time to get this conclusion and tring to deducted the scale of the original canvas is the method we use to make the things easier. Before we tried the 5*5, we get some patterns more bigger and get some good values, but they didn’t show a sign of infinite. So, we try to make this more likely happened. So, we investigate some papers and found that the 5*5 also worked, that why we get this small scale of the pattern.
